## Description
Pierre Bakery is an application that asks the user to enter how much bread, and how many pastries they would like to buy (in whole numbers).  The application then displays the total cost of the transaction, while automatically implimenting discounts.

## Application should have:

There should be two classes: one for `Bread` and one for `Pastry`.

When the user runs the application, they should receive a prompt with a welcome message along with the cost for both Bread and Pastry.

A user should be able to specify how many loaves of Bread and how many Pastrys they'd like.

The application will return the total cost of the order.

Pierre offers the following deals:

- Bread: Buy 2, get 1 free. A single loaf costs $5.
- Pastry: Buy 1 for \$2 or 3 for $5.

| input | Output |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| "Bread: 3 Pastry: 3" | The total cost for bread is: $10.  The total cost for the pastries is: $5 Your Total is: $15|
